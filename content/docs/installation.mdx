---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- Next.js 13.4 or later
- Tailwind CSS

## Initialize Your Project

If you don't have a Next.js project yet, create one:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
```

## Install Dependencies

Skie uses the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge
npm install -D @types/node
```

### Install Hugeicons

First, install the React component package:

```bash
npm install @hugeicons/react
```

Then, install the free icon pack:

```bash
npm install @hugeicons/core-free-icons
```

The free package `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` includes 4,600+ icons in the Stroke Rounded style. For more styles, consider upgrading to [Hugeicons Pro](https://hugeicons.com).

## Configure Path Aliases

Add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Add Utility Functions

Create a `lib/utils.ts` file:

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

## Install Components

Now you can start installing components. For example, to install the Raised Button:

```bash
package yet to be added
```

Or copy the component code directly from the [documentation](/docs/components/raised-button).

## Start Using Components

Import and use components in your app:

```tsx
Go to components and copy the source code. It's Free to use! 
```
